# $ about

This weblog is solely focused on offensive security learning. I am using it to build a "second brain", cataloguing my notes and train of thought as I understand more things. Once I become good enough, I will catalogue novel attack paths I create!

As of the time of writing, I am working through HackTheBox and PortSwigger labs - industry-standard, practical environments to hone hacking skills. I am looking to take my OSCP by the end of 2026, and I will share my journey here as well.

I want to become the best Penetration Tester at my company! To learn more about me, click [here]({{< ref "/whoami" >}}).
