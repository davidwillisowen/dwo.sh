I'm David Willis-Owen, a UK-based Cybersecurity professional. I started working at 18 as a Technology Degree Apprentice for a global bank, and after graduating as Valedictorian, I moved into a Penetration Tester role.

This is me:

Offensive Security is my passion! I love learning about attack techniques, especially in a practical way. This doesn't feel like work for me, and I'm truly blessed that my passion is my job.

I have done a number of other things, especially in the field of AI Security - feel free to Google my name to find out more.
